# Fantastic Networks and how to evolve them
## Understanding polygenic adaptation in the age of gene regulatory networks

This is the official GitHub accompanying my Honours thesis (finished 2021) at the University of Queensland, Brisbane/Meanjin.  

I, Stella Maria Sophie Knief, am the sole author and main contributor of this code. This repository is licensed under GNU General Public License v3.0; as such, my code may be used under the conditions set by this license. I thank Nick O'Brien for his coding suggestions while working on this project and Daniel Ortiz-Barrientos and Jan Engelstaedter for their supervision on my thesis. 

Included are all my code (including all iterations leading up to the final version, which may be accessed through the commit history), resources that I have both used and created for future use and any accompanying materials needed to recreate and appreciate the work of this year.
