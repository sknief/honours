# Fantastic Networks and how to evolve them
## Understanding polygenic adaptation in the age of gene regulatory networks

This is the official GitHub accompanying my Honours project as a part of the Ortiz-Barrientos Laboratory at the University of Queensland, Meanjin. 

Included are all my code (including all iterations leading up to the final version, which may be accessed through the commit history), resources that I have both used and created for future use and any accompanying materials needed to recreate and appreciate the work of this year.
